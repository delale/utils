"""
This script is made to copy files named with a certain pattern (usually individual
name + some more information).

3 functions are defined:
    - find_files: finds the filenames with the pattern and returns their path
        in a list
    - copy_files: copies the files to the target directory creating the new
        subdirectory if it doesn't exist yet
    - patterns: this is a specific function for a list of patterns to
        search (e.g. individuals needed for specific project). The function
        takes as input a .csv with 1 column containing the patterns list, padds
        the patterns with * so that all files containing the pattern are returned
        when running find_files, and returns a python set (exclusively iterable
        object) containing the unique patterns.

The script also creates a log file with information, files found, files copied,
and possibe errors.

USE:
    When ran as main the script automatically does everything as in the sample code.
    To run: in a terminal/cmd/powershell window move to the directory where the 
        script is stored and then run python file_scraping.py (bash) or 
        .\\file_scraping.py (powershell/cmd).
    The script can also be imported into any other python project to use its 
        functions.

WARNINGS:
    When ran directly please modify the search paths lists, the path to the 
        patterns/individuals code .csv file, and the target path.
    I advise to do this modifications in the main() function:
        as this way the automatic file scraping won't run when importing the script
        into another python project.
